# Covid-19
The Dataset comprises of six .csv files which contain information about the Covid-19 status across different countries and across the world. The data has been collected from the World Health Organization website and from several other government sources and then compiled thereafter. The six data files are explained below:

'country_wise.csv': Raw data comprising of Covid-19 statistics (total cases, active cases, recovered cases, total deaths) across different countries/regions as defined by WHO.

'day_wise_country.csv': Day-wise and country-wise Covid-19 statistics.

'day_wise_worldwide.csv': Day-wise Covid-19 Statistics for from January-2020 to July-2020 across the world.

'east_africa_covid_data.csv': cumulative number of coronavirus (COVID-19) cases in East Africa.

'kenya_county_cases.csv': Cumulative number of confirmed coronavirus (COVID-19) cases in Kenya counties.

'kenya_daily_cases.csv': Total confirmed cases daily in Kenya.

This task aims to study the Covid-19 Statistics with respect to active cases, confirmed cases, total deaths and so on across the world. Further, it analyses the countries which have been badly hit by the virus and some important ratios to find out about the deaths caused by Covid-19 virus. 

Data for COVID-19 is compiled by downloading information from various sources such as Worldometer, Africa Open Data, and Kenya Open Data. The data is be obtained in different formats, including XMLs then later converted to CSVs.
